# ansible-pull-fastbook

This is a work-in-progress. Comments are welcome, but it is now **very pre-alpha** .

The artefacts here will install a fastbook learning environment into 
an Ubuntu lxc container or workstation/server


## Development progress/process

### Ubuntu/lxc

Expecting Ubuntu LTS >= 18.04

Current development is within an lxc container running ubuntu:20.04. I will provide a profile and documentations so you can launch a container with ansible installed
